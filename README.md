  ## Description
  Generating a quality README.md file is imperative for every repository, but takes time that developers could otherwise be spending, well...developing. This template gives developers a solid shortcut for the nagging gruntwork.

  ## Media
  
  
  ## Installation
  To install, make sure the code is cloned and install inquirer along with other necessary dependencies. In the folder via the command line, type 'node index.js' and follow the on-screen prompts. Upon entry of the last input, the user should see the success message, "Generating README.md file."
